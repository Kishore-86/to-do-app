## ðŸ”§ Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Dependency Issues**

- **Solution**: 
  - Removed incorrect shadcn/ui dependency
  - Added proper Radix UI components and supporting libraries
  - Added missing dependencies: `framer-motion`, `lucide-react`, `class-variance-authority`, `tailwind-merge`

### 2. **Missing UI Components**
- **Problem**: Components importing from `@/components/ui/` didn't exist
- **Solution**: Created complete shadcn/ui component library:
  - `Badge` component with variants
  - `Button` component with multiple variants and sizes
  - `Card` component family (Card, CardHeader, CardContent, etc.)
  - `Toaster` component for notifications
  - `utils.js` with `cn()` function for className merging

### 3. **Path Resolution**
- **Problem**: `@/` imports weren't resolving correctly
- **Solution**: Updated `vite.config.js` to include proper path aliases

### 4. **Tailwind Configuration**
- **Problem**: Missing design system variables and animations
- **Solution**: Enhanced `tailwind.config.js` with:
  - Complete design system color palette
  - Custom animations and keyframes
